# Terraform AWS Infrastructure Deployment

This project uses Terraform to deploy a comprehensive AWS infrastructure including a VPC, DynamoDB table, Load Balancer (ELB), and EC2 instances. The configuration is modular and can be customized for different environments such as development, staging, and production.

## Project Overview

### Resources Deployed:
- **VPC**: A Virtual Private Cloud with subnets, routing tables, and internet gateways.
- **DynamoDB**: A NoSQL database table with customizable partition keys.
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: An application load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- **EC2 Instances**: Compute instances configured to run your applications.

## Project Structure

- **`main.tf`**: Core infrastructure configuration including VPC, DynamoDB, ELB, and EC2 resources.
- **`variables.tf`**: Defines configurable variables like region, instance types, and CIDR blocks.
- **`outputs.tf`**: Specifies the outputs of the Terraform deployment (e.g., VPC ID, EC2 public IPs, Load Balancer DNS).
- **`terraform.tfvars`**: (Optional) Provides environment-specific variable values.
- **`provider.tf`**: Configures the AWS provider.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) (v1.x.x or later)
- AWS account with permissions to create the necessary resources
- AWS CLI configured with your access keys

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/terraform-aws-infra.git
   cd terraform-aws-infra
   ```

2. **Initialize the Terraform Project:**

   Run the following command to initialize the Terraform environment and download provider plugins:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Customize Variables:**

   Adjust the variables in `variables.tf` or provide values in `terraform.tfvars`. Example `terraform.tfvars`:

   ```hcl
   aws_region          = "us-east-1"
   vpc_cidr_block      = "10.0.0.0/16"
   instance_type       = "t3.micro"
   dynamodb_table_name = "my-app-table"
   partition_key_name  = "userId"
   environment         = "production"
   ```

4. **Plan the Deployment:**

   Preview the changes that Terraform will make:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Apply the Deployment:**

   Run the following command to create the infrastructure:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the prompt with `yes` to proceed.

6. **Outputs:**

   After the deployment, Terraform will display important outputs like:

   - VPC ID
   - Public IPs of EC2 instances
   - Load Balancer DNS name
   - DynamoDB Table name

   Example output:

   ```bash
   Apply complete! Resources: 10 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

   Outputs:

   vpc_id                  = "vpc-12345678"
   ec2_instance_public_ip  = "54.123.45.67"
   load_balancer_dns       = "my-elb-123456.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
   dynamodb_table_name     = "my-app-table"
   ```

## Variable Reference

- **`aws_region`**: AWS region where resources are deployed (default: `us-west-2`).
- **`vpc_cidr_block`**: CIDR block for the VPC (default: `10.0.0.0/16`).
- **`instance_type`**: EC2 instance type (default: `t3.micro`).
- **`dynamodb_table_name`**: Name of the DynamoDB table (default: `my-dynamodb-table`).
- **`partition_key_name`**: Name of the partition key for DynamoDB (default: `userId`).
- **`environment`**: Deployment environment (default: `dev`).

## Cleanup

To delete the infrastructure and avoid any ongoing costs, run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Best Practices

- Use different workspaces for different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
- Regularly back up your state files or use a remote backend like S3.
- Follow AWS best practices for security, such as using IAM roles and securing access keys.
